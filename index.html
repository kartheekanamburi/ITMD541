            <p>
                Students in this course investigate fundamental web technologies that are crucial to the development of web-based applications that are commonly accessed through a browser. Web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages will all be covered in the course. The emphasis will be on creating up-to-date, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it works with HTML and CSS to support rich user interfaces and interoperability with other services. Additionally, modern frameworks, libraries, and tools will be examined.
